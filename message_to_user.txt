The `npm install` command failed with an `E404` error, meaning the package `@modelcontextprotocol/fetch-mcp` could not be found in the configured npm registry.

Possible reasons:
- The package name is incorrect.
- The package does not exist or has been removed.
- The package is hosted in a different npm registry that is not currently configured.

Could you please verify the package name or its availability?
